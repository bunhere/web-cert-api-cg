		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p>The goal of Web Certificate API is to define a javaScript API for certificate related operations in web applications, such as retrieving a list of certificates, obtaining a public key and a private key associated with a certificate.</p>

		<h2>Web Certificate Interfaces</h2>
		<p>The web API for certificate-based signing provides a certSign() method for the browser to accept the service provider's request and sign it with the user's private key.</p>
		<section id='example'>
			<h3>Example</h3>			
			<p>The example below signs a messageBuffer with the user's private key and verifies the message signed with the public key passed along with the signed message.</p>

		<h2>Privacy and Security Considerations</h2>
		<p>The web API for certificate-based signing handles the user's certificate and public / private key information, so the browser must pay special attention to security. This specification does not deal with spaces for storing user certificates and public / private keys, but browsers can exclude certificates and public / private keys that are not stored in secure storage. In addition, browsers can provide the ability for users to add, view, modify, or delete certificates and public / private keys used for web APIs for certificate-based signing, but are not covered in this specification.</p>
